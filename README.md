# Address Book Spring Project

## Overview

This project is a **Spring Boot** application that provides a backend for managing an address book. It exposes a **REST API** for adding, retrieving, and deleting entries in the address book. The frontend UI is developed separately and will interact with this backend.

This README provides instructions on setting up the project, running it, and testing the REST API using Postman and CURL.
